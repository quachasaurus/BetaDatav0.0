# BetaDatav0.01
You've been chosen as a BETA tester ;-)

1. Before each session open index.html and fill out how you're feeling on each category truthfully
2. Read the recommendations
3. Climb, rock on!
4. Evaluate climb based on how you climbed vs. recommendations
5. Do some feedback if you so desire
6. After a few sessions, copy the feedback and text it to me. v0.0 does not store data anywhere but local on your device
